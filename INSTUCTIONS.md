/*
  THE PROJECT - PART 2
  --------------------

  OBJECTIVE:
    A project demonstrating your ability to replace
    your Node applications visual side with React.

  TASKS:
    - Convert all views in your Project Part 1
      to React components
    - Convert your Node application to API only
    - Ensure the following still works
      - Can perform all required CRUD operations
        from with React
      - Can still login to the application
        (you don't have to have registration working
        but it's a good bonus ;) )
      - Navigation and access to various operations is
        prohibited by authentication status (logged in vs not)
